\title{Write SWBM Monthly Mountain Front Recharge (MFR) File}
\usage{
write_SWBM_MFR_file(
  mfr_df,
  output_dir,
  filename = "monthly_MFR_by_catchment.txt",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mfr_df}{A \code{data.frame} produced by \code{create_SWBM_MFR_df()}, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Stress_Period}: Date of each stress period.
\item one column per catchment ID.
}}

\item{output_dir}{Character. Directory where the file should be written.}

\item{filename}{Character. Name of the output file. Default is \code{"monthly_MFR_by_catchment.txt"}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints a message indicating which file is being written.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The primary effect is writing \code{mfr_df} to disk.
}
\description{
Writes a monthly MFR table (at the catchment scale) to a space-delimited text file
for use with the Soil Water Budget Model (SWBM). The table should have one column
named \code{Stress_Period} (Date) and one column per catchment.
}
\details{
This is a thin wrapper around \code{write_SWBM_file()}, using:
\itemize{
\item space as the field separator,
\item no quoting of values,
\item inclusion of column names but no row names.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume mfr_df was created earlier:
mfr_df <- create_SWBM_MFR_df(num_days_df)
write_SWBM_MFR_file(
  mfr_df     = mfr_df,
  output_dir = "inputs",
  filename   = "monthly_MFR_by_catchment.txt"
)
}
}
