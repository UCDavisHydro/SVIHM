\title{Write Curtailment Fractions File for SWBM}
\usage{
write_SWBM_curtailment_file(output_dir, start_date, end_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_dir}{Directory where the curtailment file will be saved.}

\item{start_date}{Start date of the simulation (as a Date object).}

\item{end_date}{End date of the simulation (as a Date object).}
}
\value{
None. Saves the curtailment fraction data as \code{curtailment_fractions.txt} in \code{output_dir}.
}
\description{
Generates and saves a file specifying water curtailment fractions for each agricultural
field for each stress period in the simulation. Fields without curtailments are assigned a default value of 0.0.
}
\details{
The curtailment fraction file is used in the SWBM model to specify reductions in applied irrigation water
due to local cooperative solutions (LCS) and regulatory curtailments. The fraction represents the proportion
of normal applied water that is reduced, with values typically ranging from 0.0 (no curtailment) to 1.0
(full curtailment).
