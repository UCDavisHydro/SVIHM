\title{Write a SWBM-Formatted Table to File}
\usage{
write_SWBM_file(df, output_dir, filename, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} whose contents will be written to disk.}

\item{output_dir}{Character. Path to the directory where the file should be written.}

\item{filename}{Character. Name of the output file (e.g. \code{"subwatershed_irrigation_inflows.txt"}).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints a message to the console indicating which file is being written.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The primary effect is the side-effect of writing \code{df} to disk.
}
\description{
Writes the contents of a data frame to a space-delimited text file suitable for
ingestion by the Soil Water Budget Model (SWBM).
}
\details{
This is a thin wrapper around \code{write.table()} that uses:
\itemize{
\item space (\code{" "}) as the field separator
\item no quoting of values
\item inclusion of column names but no row names
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose `my_df` is your SWBM input table:
my_df <- data.frame(
  Date = c("2021-01-01", "2021-01-02"),
  Flow = c(10.5, 12.3)
)
# Write it out:
write_SWBM_file(df= my_df, output_dir = "inputs", filename = "example_inflows.txt")
}
}
